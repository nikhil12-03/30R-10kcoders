            <h2>Infrared and Visible Image Fusion by Contrast and Edgepreserving Filter </h2>
        
           
                <p>As a pivotal member of the "Infrared and Visible Image Fusion by Contrast and Edge-preserving Filter" project team,
                   I was responsible for developing and implementing the fusion technique. This innovative approach aimed to
                   combine infrared (IR) and visible (VIS) images to create a comprehensive image that leverages the strengths of 
                   both imaging types.</p>
                <P>The core of my responsibility was to fuse the extracted features using a logical filter in the spatial domain. 
                    This process ensured that the final fused image retained high contrast and clarity, providing a detailed and 
                    comprehensive visual representation.</P>
            <h2>Automated Traffic Signal System</h2> 
                        <p>Designed and developed an automated traffic signal system using microcontrollers 
                            and sensors to optimize traffic flow. Implemented in C++ and integrated with hardware components.</p>
